# Metal Shot

Metal Shot is an arcade shooter, side-scrolling game inspired by Metal Slug (SNK Playmore, 1996). The player, equipped with a rapid-fire weapon with unlimited ammo, must eliminate all enemy forces encountered along the way.

The project was developed for the Object-Oriented Programming exam at Engineering and Computer Science (ISI - UniBo) located in Cesena.
